#### Source for pricing conventions
Shoutout to Professor Ritchkin for his excellent notes on US Treasury Pricing Conventions. This project would have been impossible without his book.

Individual Chapters of his book can be found from [here](https://faculty.weatherhead.case.edu/ritchken/BAFI_431_2005.htm), with the material on quoting conventions in [this chapter](https://faculty.weatherhead.case.edu/ritchken/textbook/Fixed_Income/Chap_revised_2.pdf)

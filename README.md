#### Source for pricing conventions
Shoutout to Professor Ritchkin for his excellent notes on US Treasury Pricing Conventions. The book is some welcome light in the pit of darkness and dispair that is T-bill pricing.

Individual Chapters of his book can be found from [here](https://faculty.weatherhead.case.edu/ritchken/BAFI_431_2005.htm), with the material on quoting conventions in [this chapter](https://faculty.weatherhead.case.edu/ritchken/textbook/Fixed_Income/Chap_revised_2.pdf)

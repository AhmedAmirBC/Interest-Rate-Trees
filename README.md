# Interest-Rate-Trees
A bit of code to make Binomial Interest Rate Trees

#### Source for pricing conventions
Shoutout to Professor Ritchkin for his excellent notes on US Treasury Pricing Conventions. The book is some welcome light in the pit of darkness and dispair that is T-bill pricing.

Individual Chapters of his book can be found from [here](https://faculty.weatherhead.case.edu/ritchken/BAFI_431_2005.htm), with the material on quoting conventions in [this chapter](https://faculty.weatherhead.case.edu/ritchken/textbook/Fixed_Income/Chap_revised_2.pdf)

### Further reading on Term Structure Interpolation
Having uneven and incomplete maturities in the term structure makes working with interest rate trees a nightmare. An easy solution is to interpolate the rates.

One way to do this is outlined in [this BIS paper](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap25.pdf).
